\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we show how flexible switches at the edge can be used to translate application layer header information into link layer headers to differentially route distinct qualities of ABR video segments in order to improve QoE of a HTTP/2-based application. Our demonstration is performed in a geographically distributed testbed, Chameleon, using open source orchestration and visualization tools that are easily available to researchers.
