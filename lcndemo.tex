\title{Application-based QoS support with P4 and OpenFlow: A demonstration using Chameleon}

% \subtitle{[Extended Abstract]
% \titlenote{A full version of this paper is available as%\textit{Author's Guide to Preparing ACM SIG Proceedings Using

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'

% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

%\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
Although SD-WANs are now widely deployed by several production networks, they are largely restricted to traffic engineering approaches based on layer 4 (L4) of the network protocol stack that result in improved Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the network overall without necessarily focussing on a specific application. However, the emergence of application protocols such as QUIC and HTTP/2 needs an investigation of layer 5-based (L5) approaches in order to improve users' Quality-of-Experience (QoE). In this demonstration, we leverage the capabilities of flexible switches that incorporate protocol-independent packet processing in order to intelligently route traffic based on application headers. We use Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) video streaming as an example to show how such an approach can not only provide flexible traffic management but also improve application QoE. Our prototype consists of an actual deployment in a research testbed, Chameleon, and a state-of-the-art orchestration and visualization tool, Jupyter, that we integrate with Chameleon in order to provide a single vantage point for SDN experimenters.
