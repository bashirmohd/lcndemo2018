\label{sec:demo}
We will use the testbed setup described above to systematically compare QoE metrics such as average quality bitrate for two traffic engineering approaches: one where ABR video streaming retransmissions are differentially routed using a flexible switch and another where retransmissions are classified as regular HTTP traffic without any preferential treatment. Since all of the experiment components are located in a public cloud, for this demonstration we will require a large monitor with a HDMI connector  to allow conference attendees to view as well as use the Jupyter web instance to interact with our experiment and two power outlets.
